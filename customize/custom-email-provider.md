# Custom Email Provider

To send Authgear emails to end-users with your own domain, e.g. `support@myapps.com`. You will need to configure the external SMTP provider.

Authgear currently supports **SendGrid** and other custom SMTP Providers.

The feature to configure email provider in the Portal is under development. Track the issue here: [https://github.com/authgear/authgear-server/issues/919](https://github.com/authgear/authgear-server/issues/919)
