# Deploying on Kubernetes

Before you begin, you first need to prepare an instance of PostgreSQL and Redis. Then you just prepare `authgear.yaml` and `authgear.secrets.yaml`.

`authgear.yaml` should be created as a ConfigMap while `authgear.secrets.yaml` should be a Secret.

## Example

Under construction. Come back later.
