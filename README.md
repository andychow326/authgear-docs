# Authgear

**Authgear** is an authentication server for web and mobile apps. It is highly customizable yet comes with sensible defaults. It is built on top of [OpenID Connect \(OIDC\) standard](https://openid.net/connect/), making it very easy to integrate. It supports single sign-on \(SSO\) via integration with popular providers such as Google, Apple, and Azure Active Directory \(AD\). It also supports logging in via email address and phone number with one-time password or traditional password with strong password policy. Multiple factor authentication with time-based one-time password or out-out-band one-time password is available out of the box. Users can manage their sessions in the web-based settings page. Authgear, together with popular reverse proxies such as Nginx, can work as the authentication proxy for your other services.
